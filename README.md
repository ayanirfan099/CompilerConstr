# ðŸ§  Compiler Construction Lab Tasks

This repository contains all the lab tasks and experiments completed as part of the **Compiler Construction** course during my Computer Science degree.

## ðŸ“š Course Overview

The Compiler Construction course introduced the fundamental concepts behind how programming languages are processed and translated by compilers. Topics included:

- Lexical analysis
- Syntax analysis (parsing)
- Semantic analysis
- Intermediate code generation
- Symbol table construction
- Code optimization

## ðŸ§ª Lab Contents

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific lab task.
> Each lab includes the source code, instructions, and example outputs where applicable.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- C / C++ / Python (depending on the lab)
- Custom algorithms for automata and parsing
- Command-line environments for testing

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- The code in this repository was written during learning and experimentation phases; it may not reflect optimized or production-grade implementations.
- Some labs may include manually created outputs, trace tables, or screenshots to support the results.
